#**Wifi Cracker**

##Program made in bash that allows you to obtain Wifi's passwords.

###Program works with WPA/WPA2 protocol using PSK authentication, for this option Dictionaries are needed for brute forcing

###Also you can use the program with WEP Wifi's protocol, for this option you don't need any dictionary

###Remember you need to install 'aircrack-ng':

## ```ruby <sudo apt-get install aircrack-ng>```

##And macchanger:

## ```ruby <sudo apt-get install macchanger>```

###Mediafire links for dictionaries: [Dictionaries](https://mega.nz/#F!PB0ljZwC!H1CdY80f0mrTS4AdUm3BZw)

###---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### All the process has to be done from 3 terminals. First you have to choose option 1, and then monitor interface is enabled. After that, you choose option 4 and after targetting a Wifi, you have to open a new terminal. Then execute the program again and (with Terminal 1 running) choose option 5 in Terminal 2. You have to wait 1 minute in option 5, and then press Ctrl+C. After that, open a new terminal and choose option 7 from Terminal 3 for finishing. If option 7 doesn't work, try again... that's because you need the user reconnects to the network.

###That's the error you could have
